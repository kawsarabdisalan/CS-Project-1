# History
C++ is a object oriented programming language. It was developed in 1979 by the scientist named Bjarne Stroustop at Bell Telephone Labs (Nokia Bell Labs). His initial thoughts to inventing this was to create a flecible language similar to C but more advance. 
C++ is used in many different fields including system software, game development, and application devlopment
Some applications developed with C++ are MongoDB and mySQL 
# Resources
There are many resources availble for someone who wants to learn C++. Some websites include W3Schools, GeeksforGeeks, and more. I will attach a list of resources down below.

# Installation of C++
When I was installing C++, I followed a tutorial provided by Visual Studio Code. I will attach that link below. <br>

First, I downloaded the extension C++ onto Visual Studio Code. <br>
Next, I checked if I had a complier downloaded onto my mac. To download this complier, type this into your terminal and you should have instructions to continue downloading it "xcode-select --install" <br>
To check if you have downloaded the complier, type this into your terminal: clang --version. It should give you a message that it has been installed. <br>
Next, open up a C++ file on Visual Studio Code. Name the file HelloWorld.cpp and save it into a folder. <br>
Run and debug the file and you should be able to print out Hello World using C++. 

# Questions
1. What is the recommneded app to use C++? <br> I would use Visual Studio Code to run C++
2. How do you run programs in C++? <br> Open a C++ file using the extension .cpp and start off by writing either #include <iostream> or #include <fstream> which will allow your C++ file to be able to created, written in, and read from.
3. How do you write comments in C++? <br> To write comments, use /*, */ or //.
