# CS-Project-1

#I will be doing C++ as my PLP project
#History: The C++ language is an object-oriented programming language & is a combination of both low-level & high-level language – a Middle-Level Language. The programming language was created, designed & developed by a Danish Computer Scientist – Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Telephone Laboratories (now known as Nokia Bell Labs) in Murray Hill, New Jersey. As he wanted a flexible & a dynamic language which was similar to C with all its features, but with additionality of active type checking, basic inheritance, default functioning argument, classes, inlining, etc. and hence C with Classes (C++) was launched.
